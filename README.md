### Description
Discord music bot with extensive features:
* Create playlists using keywords or Youtube links
* Shuffle and modify songs
* Text-based UI
* Various playback features

NOTE: Project currently needs various changes to be functional as one of the web APIs used has been changed and the packages used haven't been updated in quite a while since I've been dealing with college full-time.

### TODO
- [ ] switch playlist impl to JS array from linked list
- [ ] implement MongoDB for server & playlist storage

### Done
- [x] Update APIs and packages
